                One Man Chaos is Wes Lambert—father, grandfather, longtime community leader, and retired youth coach. He co-built and served as president of the Matamoros Outdoor Community Hockey Rink and founded the TDS Bowl, a nonprofit charity. A self-taught drummer since 1979, Wes created the Video Drum Solo (VDS): a story told through pictures and video, amplified by a drum performance. His One Man Drum Show uses over 100 drums, lights, and visuals to celebrate education, perseverance, and the teachers who inspire us.

                One Man Chaos is Wes Lambert—father, grandfather, longtime community leader, and retired youth coach. Wes co-built and served as president of the Matamoros Outdoor Community Hockey Rink and founded the TDS Bowl, a nonprofit charity. He&apos;s been drumming since 1979, starting in middle school and learning by doing: marching band taught snare and triples, school musicals opened the door to the kit, and real-world grit did the rest.

                Without formal lessons after graduation, Wes became a journeyman printing pressman and a self-taught drummer with a big idea: the <strong>Video Drum Solo (VDS)</strong>. Each VDS begins with images and film—places, people, and stories worth celebrating. The drums are composed last to amplify the narrative. The result is a show that blends rhythm, light, and story.

                Today, the One Man Drum Show packs over 100 drums into a 45-minute visual and musical experience. It&apos;s a thank-you to educators, a celebration of perseverance, and an invitation for every audience member to invest in learning and in themselves.

                In the words of Wes: <strong>Stand strong and drum on!</strong>
